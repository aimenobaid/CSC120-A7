Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance makes programs more organized and reusable. Once I understood how it works, it felt efficient to build classes like House, Library, and Cafe on top of a general Building class. It helped reduce repetition and made the code more modular. At first, I found it a bit confusing to know exactly where and how to use super(), but once that clicked, I saw the value in structuring classes this way.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Breaking the assignment into phases made it more manageable. Starting with House.java gave me a chance to practice extending a class with more familiar concepts like ArrayLists. I struggled a bit with the constructor calls to the parent class and making sure everything lined up with the interfaces. My advice would be to always double-check the method signatures in both your class and the interface.
